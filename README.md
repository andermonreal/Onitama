"Onitama" is a two-player abstract strategy game that combines elements of traditional board games like chess and martial arts themes. The game is set on a 5x5 grid and each player controls a Master pawn and four Student pawns. The objective of the game is to either capture the opponent's Master or move your own Master to the opponent's Temple Arch, which is the central square on the back row of the opponent's side.

At the start of the game, each player is dealt two movement cards, and a fifth card is placed face-up next to the board. These cards dictate the legal moves for any of the player's pawns. On a player's turn, they must use one of their two cards to move one of their pawns according to the pattern shown on the card. After making the move, the used card is exchanged with the fifth card, which then becomes available for the opponent on their next turn.

The movement cards are the heart of Onitamaâ€™s strategy. Each card displays a different pattern, showing how a pawn can move, and there are only a total of 16 unique cards. This limited pool of movement options means that players must carefully plan their moves while anticipating their opponent's possible actions. The game requires foresight and tactical planning, as every move changes the dynamic of the board and the available cards for both players.

"Onitama" is praised for its elegant simplicity and depth of strategy. Despite its straightforward rules, the game offers a profound level of strategic complexity, making it an engaging challenge for both casual players and seasoned strategists alike.
